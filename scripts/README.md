# Scripts

This folder will contain helper scripts for development and operations.

- Dev orchestration scripts
- Data seeding or sample generation
- Utility tools for CI and linting
 
Examples (planned):
- `dev.ps1` — starts backend and frontend together (backend on http://localhost:8000)
- `smoke.ps1` — quick backend health/datasets checks
